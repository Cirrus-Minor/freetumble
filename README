Description:

FreeTumble is a free colourfull Puzzle Game for Windows and Linux.
It features 3 game modes, with simple rules but different gameplay.

NORMAL: click zones of 3 or more stones to make them disappear. Each time you clik a zone, a new row will be added. Don't let the stones reach the top of the grid or you're done, and make a good use of the various bonus stones available !

MOTION: pretty much the same as the 'Normal' game, but real time: the new row will be added after an amount of time (decreasing as the player level increases).

CLASSIC: click zones of 2 or more stones to make them disappear. Try to clear the entire grid to get the best bonus.
